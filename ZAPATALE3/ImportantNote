KEEP IN MIND:

I wasn't able to upload certain files to the GitHub but having redownloaded the Lab Exercise folder
and testing it, it works as intended. When testing the redownloade solution, the BlogDataLibrary was
assigned as the startup project for some reason but this was easily fixed by assigning the BlogTestUI instead.
